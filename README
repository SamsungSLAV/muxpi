MuxPi
#####

**MuxPi** is an open hardware and open software board which was designed to
aid in automating tasks on physical devices. Initial goal was to automate
testing on hardware platform, thus connected devices will be called **D**\evice
**U**\nder **T**\est or shortly **DUT**\.  Muxpi is intended to help in testing
of embedded systems, automatic software installation or flashing and automation
during development. MuxPi is connected between the DUT and a PC/Server machine
which will be managing the work.  The name of the board is based on its two
main components: **SD Mux** and **NanoPi**


********
Features
********

* Providing a DUT connection (UART, USB, ETH, microSD card) to remote location
  over Ethernet
* Switching a microSD card between a DUT's microSD card slot and an onboard
  USB card reader
* Flashing a microSD card using an onboard USB card reader
* Flashing and controlling state of Samsung mobile devices over fully
  controllable, dedicated USB interface
* Switching DUT's power supply
* Switching jumpers/buttons of a DUT in order to (re)boot/(re)configure it
* Measuring power consumption of a DUT
* Handling serial connection (UART) of a DUT
* Writing EDID to a DUT over HDMI connection
* Interacting with a user/maintainer over a simple, bidirectional interface

Serial number
*************

Basically, the serial numbers consists of three parts and 15 characters:

::

[MuxPi hash ID] - [Batch number] - [Production Date]
example: 58C8F93D-054-1811

where:

1. **MuxPi hash ID** (8 alphanumeric characters) - CRC32 hash code of joint fields:

   * manufacturer ID (a country where pcb boards are manufactured)
   * assembly company ID (a country code where the device is assembled)
   * MuxPi revision number
   * PCB order number

2. **Batch number** (3 numeric characters) - increments from `000` to `999`

3. **Production date** (4 numeric characters) - format `YYMM`

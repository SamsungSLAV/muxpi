<div class="section" id="dypers">
<h3>DyPers<a class="headerlink" href="#dypers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Dynamic jumPers, so called DyPers, are simple programmatically controlled
switches that can act as a regular jumper or a switch. It is meant to help
automation when the jumpers or push buttons must be used on the DUT during
normal operations such as powering on/off. Excellent example are ARTIK boards,
which can’t be booted just by powering on. After applying power, the user is
required to press “Power on” button. Such requirement would normally rule out
automated testing.</p>
<p>Two-wire cable needs to be soldered to pins of the button (or connected to
a jumper) and connected to one of DyPers. Using software it can be switched on
and off what simulates pressing the button. Dypers are a small, electromagnetic
relays There are 2 dypers on MuxPi board. Each of them has two channels.
Both channels are switched at the same time with the same command. So both of
them can be on and both can be off but there is no way to turn one on and one
off. The two-channel design is useful for pairs of jumpers that need to be
operated as pair. If for example some board needs to have 2 jumpers linked for
flashing mode and 0 jumpers linked for normal operation then only one DyPer
with two channels may be used. These two channels are separated galvanically so
there is no worry that there will be some kind of influence.</p>
<div class="figure">

<h3>UART<a class="headerlink" href="#uart" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is smart UART for connecting NanoPi NEO to a DUT. There is no need to use
dedicated converters for particular boards because MuxPi has special level
shifter which takes care for adjusting voltages of UART lines for both sides:
NanoPi and the DUT. To take advantage of this shifter, pin VCC must be
connected to power pin on DUT’s board. Voltage shifters have operating range
from 1.6 to 5.5V.  This is 4-wire UART which means that it can communicate
using hardware flow control.</p>

set to desired value and activated. Command “uart 3300” must be sent to
Cortex-M0, where 3300 is desired voltage given in millivolts. Supported
voltage range is from 0 to 5000mV. Vloc an VCC pins must be connected in such
case, e.g. with a jumper. Vloc may be also used to power up additional
converter e.g.to RS-232C (+/-12V).</p>

<p>Below image shows how to connect UART of MuxPi to a device. In this particular
case it is 4-wire RS232C converter which must be powered from external source
(from converter’s point of view). As stated above, wire cross is done on MuxPi
board so cable should not be crossed. However in this image you can see cross
because of strange labeling of pins on the converter.</p>

</ul>
<p>This connector is an endpoint of larger entity which is dedicated to connect to
mobile devices.  Thanks to its controllable Vbus and ID lines it is possible to
control connected devices. It comprises of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ID switch with connected 1M multi-turn potentiometer - ID can be connected to
ground through potentiometer or left open. The potentiometer has 11 turns.
its value can be easily set using ohmmeter.</li>
<li>Vbus switch thanks to which power can be switched on and off. This
functionality is necessary to control connected device (power off, power on,

<li>UART/USB switch which allows to redirect mobile’s USB data lines either to
NanoPi’s USB or to MuxPi’s DUT UART.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those components are independently controlled by Cortex-M0
microcontroller. For example if there is a need to reflash a mobile device,
following steps needs to be taken:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>switch off VBus</li>
<li>disconnect the battery of the mobile device - power switch of MuxPi can be
used to accomplish this task</li>
<li>connect resistor (potentiometer) to ID pin - potentiometer should be set to
the correct value before the whole procedure is started. The value should be
valid for UART mode.</li>
<li>connect USB data lines of the mobile device to NanoPi by setting UART/USB
switch to UART mode</li>
<li>connect the battery to the mobile device</li>
<li>switch on the VBus power</li>
<li>send enter key code to the serial to stop u-boot</li>
<li>send ‘thordown’ command to u-boot through serial connection (UART) - after
this command the mobile device will switch USB data lines to USB
automatically</li>
<li>connect data lines of the mobile device to USB of NanoPi by setting UART/USB
switch to USB mode</li>
<li>start lthor/heimdall software to flash the device</li>
<li>after flashing is finished switch off VBus</li>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/board-ui.png" src="_images/board-ui.png" />
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>POWER LED - red LED indicating presence of power supply</li>
<li>SD READER LED - blue LED indicating internal SD card reader activity</li>
<li>UART VCC LED - red LED indicating presence of UART target voltage</li>
<li>(MONOCHROME) LED 1 - general purpose, green LED connected directly to NanoPi
NEO GPIO</li>
<li>(MONOCHROME) LED 2 - general purpose, red LED connected directly to NanoPi
NEO GPIO</li>
<li>RGB LED1, LED2 - two general purpose, RGB LEDs connected to Cortex-M0
microcontroller. Fully controllable by NanoPi NEO. These are WS2812B LEDs
with builtin controller.</li>
<li>128x32 OLED Display - general purpose 0.96”, graphic display.  Connected to
Cortex-M0 and fully controllable by NanoPi NEO.</li>
<li>BUTTON 1, 2 - two general purpose buttons connected to Cortex-M0
microcontroller. Fully accessible from NanoPi NEO.</li>
<li>NanoPi NEO - not shown in the above picture. Keep-alive blue LED, mounted on
NanoPi NEO board.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this UI, an operator can be informed about current status of MuxPi and
gently disturb it in order to perform some actions. Functions of UI are
customizable and can be controlled from NanoPi NEO.</p>

<h2>ADD-ONs<a class="headerlink" href="#add-ons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Add-ons are meant to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>add functionality in the future, which was unknown during design process of
MuxPi 8 add functionalities very rarely used (e.g. addon for USB ID
potentiometer adjusting) - placing them on the board would be a waste of
place.</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample add-on was designed to provide board template for users specific
boards.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/board-addon-sample.png" src="_images/board-addon-sample.png" />
</div>
<p>This add-on contains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>LEDs connected to:<ul>
<li>5V and VDD indicating power presence</li>
<li>PI GPIO 1-3 indicating state of 3 NanoPi NEO GPIOs</li>
<li>ST GPIO 1-3 indicating state of 3 Cortex-M0 GPIOs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UART0 (NanoPi NEO) to USB converter</li>
<li>lots of THT pads to ease soldering new circuits</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="programmable-units">
<h2>Programmable units<a class="headerlink" href="#programmable-units" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Muxpi contains 3 programmable units:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>NanoPi NEO - the most advanced one. It is Linux based microprocessor.</li>
<li>Cortex-M0 microcontroller - is responsible for low level actions and
is only a slave for NanoPi NEO.</li>
<li>ATtiny10 - a small AVR microcontroller which is used only a watchdog for
NanoPi NEO.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above units need software for the MuxPi board to function properly.</p>
<p>NanoPi NEO needs some distribution of linux on a micro SD card. You can
find how to setup and configure a linux distibution on other pages in this
documentation.</p>
<p>Cortex-M0 needs a firmware which is not available in the repo. There is the
whole source code that can be built according to instructions that can be found
in INSTALL file. There are also ready to flash binaries that are useful when a
user does not wan’t to build one on their own. There are two ways to flash the
microcontroller:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>flash it using some kind of SWD interface</li>
<li>flash it from NanoPi NEO</li>
</ul>
<p>Second solution is preferred as there is no single hardware nor software tool
required. All what needs to be done is to download the binary and execute
flash_firmware script with the file name as argument. It is true only if
distribution of NanoPi NEO contains proper software. To be sure just use MuxPi
dedicated distribution.</p>
<p>ATtiny10 microcontroller also needs firmware. Unfortunately this one needs
special interface e.g. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/">USBasp</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id9">[3]</a>  or any other interface which is able to flash
this microcontroller over TPI interface. Also for this microcontroller there is
a full source code and ready to flash binaries. If watchdog functionality is
not desired then instead of flashing firmware into ATTiny, R21 can be removed
from MuxPi board. In such situation NanoPi NEO will always be powered on.</p>
